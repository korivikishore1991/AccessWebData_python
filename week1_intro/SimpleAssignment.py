Instructions
Install Python and a programming text editor and write a program that prints 
one line other than 'hello world', then take two screen shots and upload them 
below. You should use the command line to execute the Python program you wrote 
in the text editor. Please do *not* use the IDLE Python Shell, the Python 
Interpreter (>>>), or a shortcut in your text editor to run the code. Later in 
the class when we start reading files, we will need to be able to run Python 
programs from particular directories. See the videos for details.
